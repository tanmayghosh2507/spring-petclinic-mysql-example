# Spring PetClinic Sample Application With MySQL

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application">See the presentation here</a>

## Running petclinic locally
```
	git clone <repo>
	cd <repo>
	mvn package
	cd target
	java -jar <jarfile>
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

## Database configuration

As this is slightly modified version of standard petclinic app, this project has explicitly MySQL configuration.

## Working with Petclinic in Eclipse/STS

### prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Maven 3 (http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/installation.html)
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Eclipse with the m2e plugin (m2e is installed by default when using the STS (http://www.springsource.org/sts) distribution of Eclipse)

Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in Help -> About dialog.
If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/


Inside Eclipse
```
File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
```
